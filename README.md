# Virtual Joystick Controller with OpenCV

## Description

This project implements a virtual joystick controller using OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand tracking. It allows users to control two servo motors based on thumb movements within defined areas on the screen, simulating a joystick interface.

## Features
- Tracks thumb movements using computer vision.
- Translates thumb positions into servo motor controls.
- Customizable for various applications in robotics and remote control systems.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- CVZone
- PyFirmata (for Arduino communication)
- Arduino board

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
2. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe cvzone pyfirmata
3. **Usage**:
    ```bash
