# virtual_thumb_controller
This project implements a virtual joystick controller using OpenCV and MediaPipe to track thumb movements. The application detects thumbs within defined squares, translating their positions into servo motor controls for X and Y axes. It serves as a foundation for exploring robotics and computer vision applications.
